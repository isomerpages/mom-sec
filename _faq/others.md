  <summary><b>1. Why was the SEC only for employees aged 55 and above? Why couldnâ€™t it have been extended to younger workers?</b></summary>
  
  In general, employment rates of older workers have increased over the years. SEC was tiered by employees' age to provide stronger support for employers hiring Singaporeans in the older age bands, where employment rates are lower.

  <summary><b>2. I am self-employed and have made contributions to my Medisave account. Am I eligible for the SEC?</b></summary>
  
  No. The SEC was only paid to employers who have made qualifying CPF contributions for their eligible employees. Hence, self-employed persons are not eligible for the SEC. However, if you employed eligible Singaporean employees, you may receive the SEC based on the mandatory CPF contributions that you have made for them.

  <summary><b>3. What was the rationale for extending SEC to employers who hire persons with disabilities (PWDs), especially those aged below 55?</b></summary>
  
  The SEC covered persons with disabilities (PWDs), including those aged below 55. This was intended to encourage employers to provide gainful employment for PWDs, so that more PWDs can enter the workforce and be active and independent.
