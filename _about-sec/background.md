# Background
From 2012 to 2016, employers who hired Singaporean employees aged above 50 earning up to $4,000 a month received SEC of up to 8% of the employee's monthly wages.

As announced at Budget 2016, the SEC was extended for three years (viz. 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019) to provide wage offsets to employers hiring Singaporean workers aged 55 and above, and earning up to $4,000. 

As announced at Budget 2019, the SEC will be extended for one more year until end-2020. <br>


#### Re-employing Older Workers not covered by the new re-employment age of 67  
To encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ Singaporeans above the re-employment age, it was announced at Budget 2015 that an additional wage offset of up to **3%** (Additional SEC or “ASEC”) would be introduced in 2015.

The re-employment age was raised from 65 to 67 from 1 July 2017. The new re-employment age of 67 applies to those who turn 65 on or after 1 July 2017; in other words, those born on or after 1 July 1952.

As announced at Budget 2019, the ASEC will be extended alongside the SEC for one more year, until end-2020. The ASEC will provide an additional wage offset of 3% to employers that hire older workers turning 67 and above.  <br>


#### Persons with Disabilities
To support employment of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)\*, the SEC was extended to employers that hire PWDs of all ages in 2012. The SEC and ASEC for PWDs are set at 16% and 22% of the employee's monthly income respectively, up to $240 and $330 per month respectively.

The one-year extension of SEC and ASEC until end-2020 will also apply to employers that hire PWDs.  <br><br>
