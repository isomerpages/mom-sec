# When will my SEC be paid

The SEC will be paid twice a year, in September and March. Employers will receive the SEC in the bank accounts that are registered with the CPF Board for the GIRO payment of CPF contributions. Employers without a GIRO arrangement with the CPF Board are encouraged to set up one. They will otherwise receive the SEC by cheque.
