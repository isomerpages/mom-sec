# When will my SEC be paid

The SEC was paid twice a year, in September and March. Employers would have received the SEC in the bank accounts that are registered with the CPF Board for the GIRO payment of CPF contributions. 

The final SEC payout was paid to eligible employers in March 2021. For any appeals related to the March 2021 payment, please write in to <a href="mailto:sec@mom.gov.sg">sec@mom.gov.sg</a> by 31 October 2021. Appeals submitted after the deadline will not be considered.
