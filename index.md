      title: Providing employers with continued support to hire older Singaporean
        workers.
      description: The Special Employment Credit (SEC) was introduced as a Budget
        Initiative in 2011 to support employers, and to raise the employability
        of older Singaporeans. It was enhanced in 2012 to provide employers with
        continued support to hire older Singaporean workers and Persons with
        Disabilities (PWDs). At Budget 2016, the SEC was extended for three
        years (viz. 2017 to 2019) to provide wage offsets to employers hiring
        Singaporean workers aged 55 and above, and earning up to $4,000. The
        Minister for Finance announced a further one-year extension of SEC to
        end-2020 at Budget 2019.
